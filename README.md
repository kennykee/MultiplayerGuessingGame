# Word Reveal (PHP)

Solution for the Geektastic challenge. To run the app or test, run either one of the following:

```
composer install
php .\index.php
php .\vendor\bin\phpunit
php .\candidate\MultiplayerGuessingGameImpl.php
```

## Requirements

- PHP 8.3
- Composer

## Tools Used

In today's software engineering world, if someone tells you they don't use AI in development, they are likely either bluffing or an old-school developer fortunate enough to have retired comfortably. The reality is, virtually every developer leverages AI tools in some form.

In this challenge, I utilized VSCode Copilot, ChatGPT, and Google Search. These tools served me in multiple ways:

1. Code completion - saving me from typing entire code blocks and endlessly scrolling to recall variable names.

2. Syntax and parameter for PHP functions like array_filter and fopen, helping me avoid unnecessary digging in PHP documentation.

That said, the true differentiator remains your ability to understand the problem deeply and to craft your own solution intelligently. AI can accelerate routine tasks and surface suggestions, but the art of software engineering lies in designing solutions that are tailored to the unique challenges.

Ultimately, it's not about if you use AI, but how you use these tools thoughtfully into your workflow to amplify your skills and productivity.
